# Political Text Analysis

## 1) Project Overview

- **Title:** Red, Blue, or Something New?: A Study of Political Text Classification
- **Team:** Amanda Rolle & Sophia Abate
- **Problem statement:**
    Can a continuous ideological dimension be constructed from political texts,
    and what linguistic features most strongly structure that dimension?
- **Hypothesis:**

## 2) Related Work (Short)

- 3-5 bullets on prior papers/blogs/repos you build on.

## 3) Data

- **Train/val/test split**:

## 4) Baseline

- **Baseline model** (name + key params):
- **Baseline metrics**:
- **Why this is a fair baseline**:

## 5) Proposed Method

- **What you change** (architecture, features, losses, etc.):
- **Why it should help**:
- **Ablations** (what you will remove to test impact):

## 6) Experiments

- **Metrics**:
- **Compute budget** (GPU/CPU limits, runtime):
- **Experiment plan** (list your runs and what each tests):

## 7) Reproducibility

- **How to run training**:
- **How to run evaluation**:
- **Where you log results** (files/paths):
