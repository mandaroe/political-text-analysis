# Class Project Template

Fill in this document at the start of the project and keep it up to date.

## 1) Project Overview

- **Title**:
- **Team**:
- **Problem statement** (1-3 sentences):
- **Hypothesis** (what you expect to happen and why):

## 2) Related Work (Short)

- 3-5 bullets on prior papers/blogs/repos you build on.

## 3) Data

- **Dataset(s)**:
- **How to access** (links or scripts):
- **License/ethics**:
- **Train/val/test split**:

## 4) Baseline

- **Baseline model** (name + key params):
- **Baseline metrics**:
- **Why this is a fair baseline**:

## 5) Proposed Method

- **What you change** (architecture, features, losses, etc.):
- **Why it should help**:
- **Ablations** (what you will remove to test impact):

## 6) Experiments

- **Metrics**:
- **Compute budget** (GPU/CPU limits, runtime):
- **Experiment plan** (list your runs and what each tests):

## 7) Reproducibility

- **How to run training**:
- **How to run evaluation**:
- **Where you log results** (files/paths):

## 8) Deliverables

- **Report** (target length and sections):
- **Demo** (notebook or script + what it shows):
- **Final results table**:

## 9) Milestones (Suggested)

- Week 1: scope, data access, baseline running
- Week 2: first model change + results
- Week 3: ablations + error analysis
- Week 4: final report + demo

## 10) Grading Rubric (Suggested)

- 30% clarity of problem + hypothesis
- 30% experimental design + baselines
- 30% results + analysis
- 10% reproducibility + code quality
